# PSHSS GWA Application

## What this app does
- Storage of General Weighted Average (GWA) into a .csv file
- Import of saved GWA from .csv file
- GWA calculation for all grade levels

## Additional purpose
This repository also serves as a practice for Git and GitHub. This is my first time making a project that was used with Git and put on GitHub. 

## Limitations as of latest version
This app currently doesn't support loading the names of the saved data. The .csv file would have to be opened to access the data. Would improve this in future
iterations.

## Modules used for this repo
- Tkinter
- csv
- os
